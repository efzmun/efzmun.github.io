During the meeting started in the afternoon, the effect was not as good as that in the morning. In fact. After the press conference, delegates from all countries had no problems with journalists since none of them paid attention to journalists' reports at all. Some countries refuse to leave when it's time to stop speaking, while others simply keep their mouth shut. Even though it has been continuously emphasized that we have not reached much  consensus, countries are still blindly distributing charitable offers to transport refugees, regardless of the scope of other countries, and some countries are even willing to provide support without considering their own scope of affordability. One country even exaggerated the problem to extinction in order to solve its own problems.  
  
Reuters believes that delegates can reach more consensus, rather than make their own demands at their own time. We are dealing with problems,not discussing them back and forth! Maybe   delegates should pay attention to this point.  Are they tired of speaking too much in the morning? Or did they not sleep well last night? Is it necessary for the chairman to  invite everyone to have coffee? Reuters hope the situation will improve!
