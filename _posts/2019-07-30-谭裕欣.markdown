 These days, the issues for human rights of refugees in recipient countries are bringing increasingly sharp focus. Delegates of all members of states are gathering together, trying to find potential approaches to the problem.  
 
  In the past few years, an increasing number of people are becoming refugees, being forced to flee their homelands. They are struggling to move to the heavens in their eyes, wishing to find proper asylums to start new livings. However, the reality is not that optimistic. European government and civil society organizations have never been fully prepared for the crisis. Accepting refugees that burst into the already crowded country is a massive task for them.   
  
  “We have already accepted too many refugees, and it is making our society less stable, so it is necessary to limit the quantity and quality of refugee sooner or later.” , as is said by the delegate of Germany.  
  
  During the session, delegates need to focus on three points including Human Rights, Refugees and Recipient Countries.   
  
  Human rights include a broad scope of topics such as the right to life and the right to liberty. The approach to improve the rights of refugees should be maintaining common benefits and endeavor to reach a consensus. Frankfurther Allgemeine Zeitung considers that possible solutions can vary to different countries, since each portion requires special discussion.  
  
  Refugees is a community that the United Nations Human Rights Council has always been caring about. The governments should not only focus on the fund and the distribution of resource, but also care about the situation that refugees are facing and lead them to the right path to a sustainable mutual-winning future.   
  
  The recipient countries are those nations that has comparatively richer resources and are willing to help the countries in need. As a well-known recipient country, Germany gets less organized due to the large amounts of refugees. In fact, it is hard to raise the quality of refugees’ life if the quantity of refugees is not limited. The measure to balance the reputation of generosity globally and the satisfactions of local people is a problem that the European countries need to discuss about. Adjustments in the systems of accepting refugees or in the countries themselves need to be made on all accounts.  
  
  Although the consensus of the conference remains a doubt, Frankfurther Allgemeine Zeitung wish the best for the successful performance of all participants. ( Frankfurther Allgemeine Zeitung/Tan Yuxin)
