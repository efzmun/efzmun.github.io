  Hunger has been a big problem throughout the world for decades. During the summit, this topic has been talked about for many times, but most of the delegates didn’t give clear solutions to this problem.
  Most developing countries asked developed countries for help. Reporter of Liberia asked developed countries for money, and he was hoping for help on technology. Reporter of Iran also mentioned that developed countries can donate money for them. But neither of them told how developed countries can help them.
  But money isn’t a long-time solution. If a child only depends on the help of others, he or she will never know how to walk. To solve the problem caused by poverty, we should focus on the government and the citizens. 
  On the topic of how to solve the problem of poverty, China has a lot to talk about. China begin to take targeted measures in poverty alleviation in 2015. This measure has already liberated six billion people from poverty. It made different plans, and this helped people to find what they can live on for different regions. For example, it connected high schools with farmers, and let the farmers sell vegetables they plant to school canteens. That’s a good idea to help the farmers.
  Most of the poor areas aren’t really lack of labor. The only resource they need is teaching. They are actually lack of people who are good at technology and management. Xinhua News Agency suggests that developing countries should send students to developed countries or developing countries which have the ability to teach students to learn management technique and agriculture technique. China is willing to accept students from these countries. In the future, these students will return to their home land and do good to their own countries. They can inject fresh blood to their home countries. Permanent change will take place in developing countries.
  The author's idea is that developed countries should send some skillful people to the developing countries. There are 5% people lose their job every month in America. These people may be a newly graduated student from MIT, or a skillful manager of a big company. There are just not enough jobs for all people to take. Then these people can work in developing countries and help both themselves and the developing countries. Watching others is always a good way to learn a skill, and it don’t need the “teachers” to have teaching skills. So developing countries can let their students watch the people from developing countries working. 
  Some people who lose their job may not want to go to developing countries to work. Developed countries can give them a job to do after they return from developing countries. Then there must be some people who wants to go for the free work.
  It is important for developing countries to learn to depend on themselves. The way to develop is to learn and to try new things. Countries should not only learn technology but also learn how to develop technology. This problem still need to be thought over seriously. 
  As an old Chinese saying says,” Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach him how to fish and you feed him for a life time.”, how to solve the problem totally still needs delegates to discuss.
  Our correspondent will continue to follow up this meeting.
